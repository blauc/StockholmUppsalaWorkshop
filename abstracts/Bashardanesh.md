Atomistic simulations of biomolecules in the presence of crowding agents can give detailed insights into the conditions inside a cell. An exponential decay of the translational diffusion coefficient with biomolecule concentration is found, independent of the protein. Interestingly, rotational diffusion of proteins is slowed down by 2-3 orders of magnitude because of non-specific interactions between biomolecules. Our results differ qualitatively and quantitatively from simple analytical models as well as from simulations without explicit solvent, highlighting that further development of simplified models needs to be based on studies involving all atomistic details.
