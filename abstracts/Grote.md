Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) solutions have been performed at conditions of hydrothermal carbonization. A number of equilibrium and dynamic properties have been computed including enthalpies of vaporization, free energies of vaporization, free energies of solvation, diffusion coefficients and rotational/reorientational correlation times. The results were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Solvation structures at these conditions have been studied using radial and spatial distribution functions. The results give insight in the structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions of furfural derivatives at subcritical conditions. Among the most interesting findings is the observed associative tendency of HMF and furfural.
