In our work, we are interested to have a nanoscale in silico investigation of
axonal damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI) which causes very high mortality
rates in European countries. In the first step, a series of bilayer structures with
similar composition to the biological plasma membrane and myelin structure will be simulated using all-atomistic and coarse grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations to study the strain rate dependency of the bilayers in presence of external forces. In the following we are going to develop an approach to couple the microscopic description of axonal membranes with the finite element description of the axon fibers.
