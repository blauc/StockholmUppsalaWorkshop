Mycobacterium smegmatis Acyl transferase (MsAcT) catalyzes acyl transfer from an acyl donor to primary and secondary alcohols and shows enantioselectivity for secondary alcohols. MsAcT is a unique enzyme that catalyzes trans-esterification reaction in aqueous solution where many other enzymes show only hydrolytic activity. This spectacular feature of MsAcT is attractive for synthetic applications. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) and free energy perturbation (FEP) to elucidate the mechanism of trans-esterification and hydrolysis reactions. Our results, in agreement with experiments, show that both these reactions have similar activation energies and the enzyme active site has a higher affinity for alcohols with hydrophobic substituent. This study opens the way to improve enzyme affinity for various substrates and to suppress the hydrolytic activity.
