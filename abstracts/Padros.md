ThDP dependent enzymes are systems of paramount interest as they catalyze, among others, carbon-carbon bond formation and they are promiscuous and easily tuneable.
Although ThDP dependent enzymes tend to conserve residues within the members of the family with similar activity, BFDC shows some differences with other decarboxylases, as the spatial distribution of two Histidines, which are catalytic in Pyruvate Decarboxylase. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis works raised important questions about the role of some residues.
A general description of the method will be presented, and the results of the description of the catalytic mechanism of BFDC will be discussed. Also, the importance of the correct choice of the initial state of the mechanism will be covered due to the high number of different states the cofactor shows.
