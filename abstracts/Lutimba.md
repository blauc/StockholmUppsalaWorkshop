Proteins in the membrane mediate the exchange of substances between cellular environments forming the basis of transmembrane traffic in cellular metabolism. Active transport, unlike passive transport, uses the free energy released from ATP hydrolysis or the free energy stored in an electrochemical proton gradient to transport substances across biological membranes. The current focus in this project is to determine the molecular basis for secondary active transport in Lactose permease using molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular determinants that govern substrate affinity and specificity as well as the proton-coupled transport mechanism will be explored. SMD,TMD and umbrella sampling method will be employed to track differences in protein interactions and pathways in different protonation states of the protein. This will have a wide impact in understanding membrane transport mechanism.
