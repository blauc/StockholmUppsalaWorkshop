Fragment-based lead discovery has emerged as a leading drug development strategy for novel therapeutic targets. Although the technique benefits immensely from access to atomic-resolution information, molecular docking has rarely been used to drive fragment discovery and optimization. Here, molecular docking of 0.3 million fragments to a crystal structure of cancer target MTH1 was performed. Twenty-two predicted fragment ligands were experimentally evaluated. Five fragments inhibited MTH1 and structure-based optimization guided by predicted binding modes and analogs from commercial chemical libraries yielded nanomolar inhibitors, confirmed by solved crystal structures. Molecular docking of commercial chemical space gives access to fragment libraries that are several orders of magnitude larger than those screened experimentally and can enable efficient optimization of hits to potent leads.
