Classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and 2-D metadynamics simulations have been performed with cholesterol in different lipid bilayers in order to study it's behaviour on the microsecond time-scale. Lipids which were studied with metadynamics: 12:0-12:0 PC, 14:0-14:0 PC, 18:0-18:0 PC, 22:6-22:6 PC, 20:4-20:4 PC, 20:0-20:0 PC, 22:0-22:0 PC, 18:2-18:2 PC, 18:0-18:2 PC. For  MD simulations the list of lipids was extended with 18:0-22:6 PC, 18:0-20:4 PC as well as different concentrations of cholesterol were taken into account for studies with 22:6-22:6 PC and 14:0-14:0 PC. The used force field was SLipids v2.0.   The purpose was to see the most probable positions of the molecule in different bilayers depending on their phases and thicknesses. Convergence of metadynamics has been studied in different lipid bilayers in order to see how it is affected by the lipid phase.
