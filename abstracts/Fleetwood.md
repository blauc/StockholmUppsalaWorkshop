G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) make up a large protein family of receptors of high significance which act as targets for more than 30% of all the drugs sold worldwide. GPCRs bind to molecules outside the cell membrane and trigger a response inside of the cell through a conformational change between an active and an inactive state. To control and understand the activation pathway is highly important for effective drug design. In our current work, we use long timescale molecular dynamics simulations of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor together with tools borrowed from machine learning to derive and analyze the minimum free energy path between the active and inactive state. Finally, the results are used to set up new enhanced sampling simulations and to define important degrees of freedom, following a methodology which can be applied to other systems as well.
